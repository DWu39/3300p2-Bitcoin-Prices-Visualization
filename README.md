Visualizing Bitcoin prices using D3.js

We had been tracking the price of Bitcoin per minute for about 6 months (December 2013 - May 2014). After cleaning the data and aggregating prices to different time periods (hours, months, etc.), we used the D3.js library to create a tool for exploring trends.

The user is presented with a line graph that shows time on x-axis and price on y-axis. Interaction with the graph includes zooming and dragging. One can zoom in to view shorter time periods and zoom out to view a longer period such as by month.
